        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm a passionate scientist dedicated to exploring the mysteries of the world we live in. I made this website to be a small scientific corner for me to share the research I've been doing for the last decade as well as any future research or experiments that I'll be doing.</p>
        <p>I specialize in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security">computer security</a> & love science in general. I'm known for my out of the box thinking which I use to solve problems & formulating hypotheses. My experiments are generally based upon simple questions or driven by the curiosity to understand a natural behavior or even sometimes a simple goal. However, an important detail is I always try to keep my experiments replicable & ensure that it's as unbiased as possible to ensure I follow the doctrine of science as much as I can. This is mainly due to the fact that I wish to one day publish some research I conducted in the scientific community papers so that I may contribute in a more formal way. Experiments that are done without following the principles of science might be fun, but they aren't as satisfying to me.</p>
        <p>I also wrote some articles on <a href="https://omertasecurity.com/author/sjdhfjlasl/">Omerta Security</a>'s blog in the past which pertained to <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> & <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>. I've spent the better part of the last decade learning about computer security, programming, computer science & anything I could get my hands on that was related to electronics with a dash of biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics as well as anything else that I stumbled upon.</p>
        <p>Follow me on social media to stay updated on my latest experiments and scientific adventures!</p>
